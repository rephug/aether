# Security Policy

## Secrets and API Keys

- Never commit API keys, tokens, passwords, or `.env` files.
- Use environment variables for secrets (for example `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- `.env` is local-only development configuration and must stay untracked.

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue, open a private security advisory in GitHub (preferred) or contact the maintainers directly.
